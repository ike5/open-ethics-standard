[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue.svg)](CHANGELOG.md)

A comprehensive, referenceable framework for ethical software business practices. Unlike aspirational corporate slogans,
the OES is designed to be a **binding commitment** with real accountability mechanisms.

## Why This Exists

Too many software companies follow a predictable pattern: attract users with great service, lock them in, then extract
maximum value through degraded quality, price increases, and dark patterns. This is sometimes called "enshittification."

The Open Ethics Standard provides:

- **A taxonomy of unethical practices** — so we can name and recognize them
- **Concrete commitments** — not vague promises, but specific, measurable standards
- **Enforcement mechanisms** — accountability with real consequences
- **Referenceable provisions** — cite specific violations like "OES 1.2.5"

## Quick Start

### For Companies Adopting the OES

1. Read the full [Open Ethics Standard](open-ethics-standard.md)
2. Integrate the OES into your Terms of Service by reference
3. Implement the [checklist](open-ethics-standard.md#appendix-c-implementation-checklist) in Appendix C
4. Publish your commitment publicly
5. Conduct annual audits against the standard

### For Users & Advocates

Use the OES to hold companies accountable:

> "Company X is violating OES 1.2.5 (Cancellation Mazes) by requiring a phone call to cancel a subscription that took
> one click to start."

### For Contributors

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to propose changes, report issues, or suggest new provisions.
