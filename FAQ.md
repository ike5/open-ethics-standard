## General Questions

### What is the Open Ethics Standard?

The Open Ethics Standard (OES) is a comprehensive framework for ethical software business practices. It provides a
taxonomy of unethical practices (what to avoid), concrete ethical commitments (what to do instead), and a referenceable
numbering system that allows anyone to cite specific violations (e.g., "OES 1.2.5").

### Is the OES legally binding?

No. The Open Ethics Standard is not a law, regulation, or legally enforceable contract. It is a voluntary ethical
framework designed to:

- **Deter** unethical practices by making them explicitly identifiable
- **Educate** consumers about manipulative business tactics
- **Provide accountability** through public tracking of reported violations
- **Encourage** industry-wide adoption of ethical standards

Companies that adopt the OES do so voluntarily. The standard's power comes from transparency and public awareness, not
legal enforcement.

### Why was the OES created?

Too many software companies exploit users through dark patterns, subscription traps, hidden fees, and data abuse.
Existing frameworks are often either too vague ("Don't be evil") or too narrow (focusing only on privacy or
accessibility). The OES provides a comprehensive, specific, and referenceable standard that covers the full spectrum of
ethical concerns in software businesses.

### How is the OES different from B Corp certification?

| Aspect               | Open Ethics Standard               | B Corp Certification              |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Cost**             | Free                               | Paid certification fees           |
| **Focus**            | Software/SaaS-specific practices   | Broad social/environmental impact |
| **Specificity**      | Detailed, referenceable provisions | General assessment criteria       |
| **Enforcement**      | Public violation database          | Certification revocation          |
| **Barrier to Entry** | None (voluntary adoption)          | Assessment process required       |

The OES and B Corp are complementary. A company could pursue both.

## For Companies

### How do we adopt the OES?

1. Read the full [Open Ethics Standard](OES.md)
2. Audit your current practices against the standard
3. Address any violations
4. Publicly commit to the OES (e.g., on your website, in your Terms of Service)
5. Maintain compliance over time

### Do we have to adopt all provisions at once?

Yes. The OES is designed as a complete standard and should be adopted in full.

**Important:** If your company is currently violating any OES provision, that violation exists whether or not you have
formally "adopted" the OES. The standard describes ethical practices—not adopting it does not make unethical practices
acceptable. If you are violating a section, you should consider it an infraction already.

We recommend:

- Conduct a full audit against all OES provisions
- Prioritize fixing active violations immediately
- Publicly commit once you are in full compliance

### What if we accidentally violate a provision?

Accidental violations can happen. Here's how they are handled:

1. **Public Reporting**: Users may report the violation to the OES database with a screenshot and reference number
2. **Time-Limited Listing**: Your company will appear in the violation database for **6 months** from the date of the
   report (for that specific violation)
3. **Proof Required**: Reports must include evidence (screenshot, documentation)
4. **Expiration**: After 6 months without new reports of the same violation, the entry expires
5. **Pattern Detection**: Repeated reports of the same violation reset the 6-month window and indicate a systemic issue
   rather than an accident

The best response to an accidental violation:

- Acknowledge it publicly
- Fix the issue promptly
- The database listing will expire naturally after 6 months if corrected

### Can competitors abuse the reporting system against us?

The violation database requires evidence (screenshots, documentation). False reports without valid evidence will not be
accepted. The system is designed to track genuine violations, not facilitate harassment.

If you believe a report is fraudulent, you may contest it through the dispute process (
see [Violation Reporting & Database](#disputing-a-report)).

### Does OES compliance mean we can't be profitable?

Absolutely not. The OES prohibits *exploitative* monetization, not monetization itself.

**Prohibited (Exploitative):**

- Surprise price increases on locked-in users
- Cancellation mazes designed to trap users
- Hidden fees revealed only at checkout
- Selling user data without consent
- Degrading service to force upgrades

**Allowed (Ethical):**

- Transparent subscription pricing
- Tiered plans with clear feature differences
- Price increases with proper notice (90 days) and price-lock options
- Premium support and services
- Usage-based pricing with clear metering
- Annual discounts for commitment

Companies like Basecamp, Notion, Patagonia, and many others have demonstrated that ethical practices and profitability
are compatible. Ethical treatment builds trust, reduces churn, increases referrals, and avoids regulatory scrutiny.

## For Users & Advocates

### How do I use the OES to hold companies accountable?

When you encounter an unethical practice, identify the relevant OES provision and cite it specifically:

> "This 12-step cancellation process violates **OES 1.2.5** (Cancellation Mazes) and **OES 9.1.3** (Cancellation shall
> be completable within 3 clicks/taps)."

You can use OES references in:

- Social media posts
- Customer support complaints
- Reviews and ratings
- Regulatory complaints (FTC, state attorneys general)
- Violation reports to the OES database

### How do I find the right provision to cite?

1. **Quick Reference Index**: The [OES.md](OES.md#quick-reference-index) includes a quick reference for commonly cited
   violations
2. **Part I (Sections 1–6)**: Taxonomy of unethical practices—use these to identify *what the company is doing wrong*
3. **Part II (Sections 7–13)**: Ethical commitments—use these to cite *what the company should be doing instead*

**Common violations:**

| If you experience...            | Cite...                       |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Difficult cancellation          | OES 1.2.5, 9.1.1–9.1.5        |
| Hidden fees at checkout         | OES 1.3.1, 2.1.1, 8.4.1–8.4.2 |
| Guilt-tripping opt-out language | OES 2.1.7, 2.2.2, 11.1.1      |
| Fake urgency/scarcity           | OES 2.1.4–2.1.6, 11.1.2       |
| Features moved behind paywall   | OES 1.1.8, 8.2.1–8.2.3        |
| Confusing privacy settings      | OES 2.1.12, 10.3.1–10.3.4     |
| No way to export data           | OES 3.3.1–3.3.4, 9.3.1–9.3.4  |

### What if a company hasn't adopted the OES?

The OES describes ethical practices that *all* software companies should follow, regardless of whether they have
formally adopted the standard. A company's failure to adopt the OES does not excuse unethical behavior.

You can still:

- Report violations to the OES database
- Cite OES provisions in complaints and reviews
- Advocate for the company to adopt the standard

## Violation Reporting & Database

### How do I report a violation?

1. **Identify the violation**: Determine which OES provision(s) apply
2. **Gather evidence**: Take a screenshot or record documentation of the violation
3. **Submit a report**: File a report through the OES violation database including:
    - Company name
    - OES reference number(s) violated
    - Screenshot or evidence (required)
    - Brief description
4. **Review**: Reports are reviewed for validity before being added to the database

### What happens when I report a violation?

Once a valid report is submitted:

1. **Database Entry**: The company is added to the public violation database for that specific provision
2. **6-Month Window**: The entry remains visible for **6 months** from the report date
3. **Aggregation**: Multiple reports of the same violation are aggregated to show frequency
4. **Statistical Probability**: The database calculates a statistical probability of violation based on report volume
   and patterns
5. **Expiration**: If no new reports of that violation occur within 6 months, the entry expires and is removed from
   active display

### How does the statistical probability work?

The violation database aggregates reports to calculate the likelihood that a company is violating a specific provision:

- **Single report**: Indicates a potential violation (may be isolated incident)
- **Multiple reports**: Increases statistical confidence of systematic violation
- **Report frequency**: Recent, frequent reports weigh more heavily than old, sparse reports
- **Evidence quality**: Reports with clear screenshot evidence are weighted more heavily

This system helps distinguish between one-off mistakes and patterns of abuse. The more reports with valid evidence, the
higher the statistical probability that a company is systematically violating the standard.

### Disputing a Report

If a company believes a report is inaccurate or fraudulent:

1. **Submit a dispute** through the database with counter-evidence
2. **Review process**: Disputes are reviewed by maintainers
3. **Resolution**: Reports may be removed if found to be invalid, or upheld if evidence supports the violation

### Why do entries expire after 6 months?

The 6-month expiration serves several purposes:

- **Encourages correction**: Companies have an incentive to fix violations (the entry will expire)
- **Reflects current state**: The database shows recent behavior, not ancient history
- **Allows recovery**: Companies that reform are not permanently penalized
- **Resets on repeat offense**: New reports of the same violation restart the 6-month window

A company with no active violations has a clean record. A company with continuous reports will have continuous database
presence.
