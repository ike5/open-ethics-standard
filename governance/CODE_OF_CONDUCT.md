# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

The Open Ethics Standard exists to make software more ethical and user-respecting. In that spirit, we as contributors
and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of
age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

### Expected Behavior

**Be respectful and constructive.** Engage with ideas on their merits. Critique proposals, not people.

**Be collaborative.** The OES improves through collective effort. Share knowledge, help newcomers, and build on others'
contributions.

**Be transparent.** Disclose relevant affiliations when discussing provisions that may affect your organization.
Transparency is a core OES principle—we hold ourselves to it too.

**Be precise.** The OES aims for enforceable standards, not vague aspirations. Bring the same rigor to discussions: cite
specific provisions, provide evidence for claims, and acknowledge uncertainty.

**Be patient.** Not everyone has the same background in ethics, law, or technology. Help others understand rather than
dismissing their questions.

**Assume good faith.** Contributors may disagree about what constitutes ethical practice. Assume others are genuinely
trying to improve the standard, even when you disagree with their approach.

### Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable:

- Personal attacks, insults, or derogatory comments
- Trolling, inflammatory remarks, or deliberate provocation
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Dismissing or attacking identity-based experiences or perspectives
- Sustained disruption of discussions
- Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors

### Specific to the OES Context

Given the nature of this project, additional standards apply:

**No astroturfing.** Do not pose as an independent contributor while representing corporate interests without
disclosure.

**No bad-faith arguments.** Do not argue for weakening protections while claiming to strengthen them.

**No retaliation.** Do not harass or target individuals who have reported violations of this Code of Conduct or
violations of the OES itself.

**Evidence-based claims.** When reporting violations or proposing provisions, provide verifiable evidence. Do not make
unsubstantiated accusations against specific companies.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including:

- GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, and Discussions
- Project-related communications (email, social media)
- Representing the project at public events

It also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project
maintainers at:

**Email:** [maintainer email to be added]

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy
and security of the reporter.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers will follow these guidelines in determining consequences:

#### 1. Correction

**Trigger:** First-time minor violation or unintentional offense

**Action:** Private written warning with clarity around the nature of the violation and why the behavior was
inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Trigger:** A pattern of minor violations or a single more serious violation

**Action:** A formal warning with specified consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with involved parties
for a specified period (typically 30 days). Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Trigger:** A serious violation or sustained inappropriate behavior

**Action:** Temporary ban from all project interaction (typically 90 days). No public or private communication with
maintainers or other community members regarding the project. Returning after a temporary ban requires acknowledgment of
the violation and commitment to follow the Code of Conduct.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Trigger:** Demonstrated pattern of violation, harassment of an individual, or egregious single incident

**Action:** Permanent removal from all project spaces.

### Appeals

Individuals subject to enforcement actions may appeal by emailing the maintainers with:

1. The specific action being appealed
2. Why they believe the action was inappropriate
3. Any relevant context not previously considered

Appeals will be reviewed within 14 days.

## Maintainer Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior. They have the right
and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that
do not align with this Code of Conduct.

Maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions
as determined by other project leadership.
