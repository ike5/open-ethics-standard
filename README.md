A comprehensive, referenceable framework for ethical software business practices.

## Purpose & Vision

### Why the Open Ethics Standard Exists

The Open Ethics Standard exists because the current landscape of software and technology is rife with exploitative
practices that harm users, stifle competition, and erode public trust. Dark patterns, subscription traps, data abuse,
and deliberate service degradation have become normalized. The OES provides a structured response: a common language for
identifying these practices, a public mechanism for accountability, and a pathway for companies that want to do better.

At its core, the OES reflects a philosophical premise: **businesses operate with the implicit permission of the public
they serve.** When companies exploit that relationship, the public has the right to name, document, and respond to those
violations. The OES is not a license granted by an authority — it is a standard maintained by the community, for the
community.

---

### For Consumers

**Public Accountability for Corporate Behavior**

The OES empowers consumers to hold companies accountable. By providing specific, referenceable provision numbers (e.g.,
OES 1.2.5), users can precisely identify and document violations. The public violation database aggregates this
information, creating a transparent record of company practices that anyone can access. This shifts power back to
consumers, who can make informed decisions and apply collective pressure for change.

**A Moral Compass Made Visible**

Many unethical practices thrive because they are difficult to name or explain. The OES provides clear definitions and
categories — confirmshaming, cancellation mazes, enshittification — that make these practices visible and
understandable. This shared vocabulary helps the general public recognize manipulation when they encounter it and
articulate why it is wrong.

**Reinforcing Existing Protections**

Regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and FTC rules have established important consumer protections, but enforcement is slow and
inconsistent. The OES reinforces these standards by making violations publicly visible, creating reputational
consequences that complement legal ones. Companies that violate the spirit of these regulations — even when technically
compliant — can still be held accountable through the OES framework.

**Improving the Quality of Digital Experiences**

When exploitative practices are tolerated, the overall quality of software and digital services declines. The phenomenon
of "enshittification" — where platforms deliberately degrade to extract value from locked-in users — has become
pervasive. The OES pushes back against this trend by documenting these practices and creating public consequences. Over
time, this raises the baseline expectation for how software should treat its users, reducing low-quality, exploitative
applications and improving the digital ecosystem as a whole.

### For Companies

**A Level Playing Field for Ethical Competitors**

Smaller companies often struggle to compete against incumbents that use exploitative practices to lock in users and
extract maximum revenue. The OES helps level this playing field by making those practices visible and costly. When
consumers can easily identify which companies engage in dark patterns or subscription traps, ethical competitors gain an
advantage. Companies that treat users well can differentiate themselves in a marketplace where that distinction is now
measurable.

**A Mark of Dedication to Good Business**

Just as the Better Business Bureau (BBB) provides a signal of trustworthiness, commitment to the OES demonstrates a
company's dedication to ethical practices. Companies can publicly commit to the standard, and their compliance is
verified by the absence of violations in the public database. This creates a credible signal that goes beyond marketing
claims — it is backed by community oversight and documented evidence.

**Identification of Risks and Best Practices**

The OES provides a comprehensive taxonomy of unethical practices, serving as a reference for what to avoid. For
companies building new products or reviewing existing ones, this taxonomy acts as a checklist: if your practices appear
in Part I of the OES, you are at risk of public accountability — and potentially legal action as regulations catch up.
Conversely, Part II provides clear commitments that companies can adopt to ensure they are on the right side of ethical
standards. This makes compliance easier by providing specific, actionable guidance rather than vague principles.

**Reducing Legal and Reputational Risk**

Many practices documented in the OES are already subject to regulatory scrutiny (FTC Click-to-Cancel, GDPR consent
requirements, state auto-renewal laws). By aligning with the OES, companies reduce their exposure to future enforcement
actions and class-action lawsuits. The OES provides a framework for identifying and remediating risky practices before
they become legal liabilities. Prevention is far less costly than litigation.

## What is the Open Ethics Standard?

The Open Ethics Standard (OES) is a framework designed to categorize, describe, and prevent unethical business practices
in software-as-a-service (SaaS) and technology companies. Unlike aspirational statements, the OES provides **specific,
enforceable standards** with unique reference numbers for accountability.

The OES provides:

- **A taxonomy of unethical practices** — what to avoid
- **Concrete ethical commitments** — what to do instead
- **Enforcement mechanisms** — how to hold companies accountable
- **Referenceable provisions** — cite specific violations like "OES 1.2.5"

---

## Quick Start

### For Companies Adopting the OES

1. Read the full [Open Ethics Standard](OES.md)
2. Review the [Implementation Checklist](OES.md#appendix-c-implementation-checklist)
3. Add to your Terms of Service: *"[Company] commits to the Open Ethics Standard v1.0.0"*

### For Users & Advocates

Reference specific violations when holding companies accountable:

> "This cancellation process violates **OES 1.2.5** (Cancellation Mazes) and **OES 9.1.3** (Cancellation shall be
> completable within 3 clicks/taps)."
